Code Highlighter Macro For Mephisto
-----------------------------------

A small plugin that provides a filter to wrap code that will then be picked up by CodeHighlighter for client side highlighting.


Usage
-----

Ensure the code highlighter scripts are installed into your javascripts dir.  After this, add the javascript include statements into your layout:

  {{ 'code_highlighter' | javascript }}
  {{ 'javascript' | javascript }} <!-- one of these for each language you want to support -->

Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS are included but you can write you own grammars easily.

Then in your posts do:

   <filter:jscode lang="javascript">document.someScriptThing = "BOO"</filter:jscode>
